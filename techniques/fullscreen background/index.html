    <p>
      The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in
      New York City and is one of the oldest bridges of either type in
      the United States. Completed in 1883, it connects the boroughs of
      Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River. It has a main
      span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and was the first steel-wire suspension
      bridge constructed.

      It was originally referred to as the New York and Brooklyn Bridge and
      as the East River Bridge, but it was later dubbed the Brooklyn Bridge,
      a name coming from an earlier January 25, 1867, letter to the editor
      of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle[7] and formally so named by the city
      government in 1915.

      Although the Brooklyn Bridge is technically a suspension bridge,[11]
      it uses a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge design. The towers
      are built of limestone, granite, and Rosendale cement. The limestone
      was quarried at the Clark Quarry in Essex County, New York.[12]
      The granite blocks were quarried and shaped on Vinalhaven Island,
      Maine, under a contract with the Bodwell Granite Company, and delivered
      from Maine to New York by schooner.[13]

      Construction of the bridge began in 1869.[11] The bridge was initially
      designed by German immigrant John Augustus Roebling, who had previously
      designed and constructed shorter suspension bridges, such as Roebling's
      Delaware Aqueduct in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, the Waco Suspension
      Bridge[16] and the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge between Cincinnati,
      Ohio, and Covington, Kentucky.

      While conducting surveys for the bridge project, Roebling sustained a
      crush injury to his foot when a ferry pinned it against a piling.
      After amputation of his crushed toes he developed a tetanus infection
      which left him incapacitated and soon resulted in his death in 1869,
      not long after he had placed his 32-year-old son Washington Roebling
      in charge of the project.[17]

      The bridge's two towers were built by floating two caissons, giant
      upside-down boxes made of southern yellow pine, in the span of the East
      River, and then beginning to build the stone towers on top of them until
      they sank to the bottom of the river. Compressed air was pumped into
      the caissons, and workers entered the space to dig the sediment, until
      the caissons sank to the bedrock. The whole weight of the bridge still
      sits upon a 15-foot thickness of southern yellow pine wood under
      the sediment.[18]
