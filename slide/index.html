  <h2>Hello</h2>
  <p>
    Mary, the only surviving legitimate child of James V of
    Scotland, was six days old when her father died and she
    acceded to the throne. She spent most of her childhood in
    France while Scotland was ruled by regents, and in 1558, she
    married the Dauphin of France, Francis. He ascended the
    French throne as King Francis II in 1559, and Mary briefly
    became queen consort of France, until his death in December
    1560. Widowed, Mary returned to Scotland, arriving in Leith
    on 19 August 1561.

    Mary was baptised at the nearby Church of St Michael shortly
    after she was born.[10] Rumours spread that she was weak and
    frail,[11] but an English diplomat, Ralph Sadler, saw the
    infant at Linlithgow Palace in March 1543, unwrapped by her
    nurse, and wrote, "it is as goodly a child as I have seen of
    her age, and as like to live."
